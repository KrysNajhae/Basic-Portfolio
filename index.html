        <p> An aspiring entrepreneur trying to brand myself. I recently finished cosmetology school at Orange Technical College-Westside campus and received my license. Now I'm in code school learning about web development,creating HTML's and using CSS. I plan on using this knowledge to pursue a career in coding also. More about me, I was born in NY and raised in Orlando,Fl. Since I was younger I was always fascinated with all things beauty, so that inspired me to become a cosmetologist. After cosmetology school it was kind of difficult to get into a salon. When your fresh out of school some arent really fond of new stylists. So with that I decided to take another route. Web Development. I feel like with my creativity im a good candidate for this. I'm really looking forward to being able to grow in this field and learn a lot along the way.
